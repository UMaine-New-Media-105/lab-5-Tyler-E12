exercise 1 - https://editor.p5js.org/Tyler_E/sketches/ydSyuADQz - This code creates a sprite of a frog, which bounces off of the borders of the canvas. Variables are used to
make the the speed random each time it's drawn, as well as the trajectory of the sprite itself. I used else-if statements to make sure that the sprite bounced at borders of
the canvas by making the speed become the inverse of itself if it reached those pixels.
exercise 2 - https://editor.p5js.org/Tyler_E/sketches/RNnUilO_8 - This code creates a sprite of a frog, which bounces off of the borders of the canvas. Variables are used to
make the the speed random each time it's drawn, as well as the trajectory of the sprite itself. I used else-if statements to make sure that the sprite bounced at borders of
the canvas by making the speed become the inverse of itself if it reached those pixels. Unlike the first exercise, the sprite is also able to be controlled with key presses.
I made it so when one of the arrow keys is pressed, the sprite will move in the correlating direction.
